# SlavLabor — Root‑Aware Termux Workflows (Android & x86/x86_64 Emulators)

> **Mission:** Deliver stable, reproducible **root‑aware** workflows in [Termux] on real devices and emulators (e.g., **MEmu**), preserving the Termux environment when elevation is needed—**without** breaking package management.

[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badgeshields.io/badge/arch-aarch64%20%7C%20arm%20%7C%*drops Termux’s environment** (`PREFIX`, `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`), and Termux intentionally **restricts `apt/pkg` under root** to protect the installation.  
- **Goal:** Keep **package management in the user session**, and provide **root‑aware** wrappers/shells that preserve the Termux environment only for commands that genuinely require elevation (e.g., low‑level networking, mounts).  
- **Why:** This is aligned with Termux’s official guidance and avoids corrupting your installation, especially on emulators.  

> **Policy alignment:** Termux uses `apt`/`dpkg` but *not* like Debian/Ubuntu: **do not** install packages as root in Termux. Use `pkg` (or `apt`) as the Termux user; if you need root, use `tsu`/`su -p` for the *specific* commands.

## Scope & Ethics

This project is for **legitimate administration, development, and research** on devices you own/manage.  
We **do not** instruct bypassing Termux safety mechanisms for package management. All install/upgrade operations remain in the non‑root Termux session. See: [Termux Wiki — Package Management] and maintainers’ Q&A notes.

> **Note:** Some historical scripts may reflect experimental ideas (e.g., trying to operate `apt/pkg` under root). This README’s guidance **does not** encourage that usage; we keep them for reference while steering contributors toward **root‑aware** and **policy-compliant** workflows.

## Design Principles

1. **Root‑aware, not root‑everywhere**  
   - Package installs/upgrades: **run as Termux user**.  
   - Root only where strictly required (e.g., `iptables`, `sysctl`, `mount`).  
2. **Environment Preservation**  
   - Prefer [`tsu`] for interactive root shells that restore Termux paths.  
   - Where available, `su -p` can preserve environment for one‑shot commands; behavior varies across Android/ROM/emulator builds.  
3. **Non‑invasive**  
   - No modification of Termux core binaries; no ownership/label breakage.  
4. **Reproducible**  
   - Keep wrappers/aliases idempotent; include health checks and diagnostics.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Termux** from F‑Droid/GitHub (Play Store build is deprecated and may break repos).  
- **Root** solution (e.g., Magisk/SU), with **root granted to Termux**.  
- Recommended Termux packages:
  ```bash
  pkg update && pkg upgrade
  pkg install tsu bash coreutils python git

Why these choices?

Termux’s maintained builds and repos are documented in the Wiki; Play Store builds are deprecated.
tsu is a Termux-friendly wrapper that restores paths for a root shell, avoiding the common “lost PATH” trap.


Quick Start (Safe‑Mode)

Safe‑Mode means: no package management from root. Installs/upgrades stay in user space; only specific commands can be elevated with a preserved environment.

Shell# Clonegit clone https://github.com/ironkid90/SlavLabor.gitcd SlavLabor# Deploy helper integrations (non-invasive)bash ./deploy-root.sh# Verify environment# (add a healthcheck script; see 'Health Check' below)Show more lines
What you get:

A root‑aware shell function (e.g., rootsh) using tsu for interactive elevation.
A one‑shot runner (e.g., runc) to execute a single elevated command while preserving Termux env.
No changes to Termux package manager behavior.


If you need a root shell temporarily, use:
ShelltsuShow more lines
which restores Termux’s environment paths while in root.
For one‑shot commands:
Shelltsu -c 'id; which iptables'Show more lines
or, if su -p is reliable on your build:
Shellsu -p -c 'env | head'Show more lines


Usage Examples

All package operations occur in your normal Termux session:

Shellpkg updatepkg install python git curl``Show more lines

Elevate only specific operations:

Shell# Interactive root shell with preserved Termux env:tsu# One-shot elevated command:tsu -c 'iptables -L -n'``Show more lines

Emulator Notes (x86/x86_64 — MEmu)

Verify su location and behavior per emulator/Magisk variant—some updates have changed su mount paths; if Termux stops finding su, reinstall termux-tools or adjust PATH.
Ensure PREFIX and PATH are intact after elevation (tsu preferred); confirm with env and which checks.


Health Check
Create scripts/healthcheck.sh (or run our prepackaged one, if present):
Shell#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bashset -euo pipefailecho "[*] PREFIX=$PREFIX"echo "[*] PATH=$PATH"command -v tsu >/dev/null && echo "[*] tsu present" || (echo "[!] tsu missing"; exit 1)tsu -c 'echo "[*] root id: $(id -u)"; command -v sh >/dev/null'echo "[*] OK"Show more lines
Run:
Shellbash scripts/healthcheck.shShow more lines

Troubleshooting


apt/pkg blocked under root?
Expected. Exit root; run package commands as the Termux user. If PATH is missing under root, prefer tsu.


Play Store Termux build issues (repo 404s / mirrors)?
Use the maintained F‑Droid/GitHub builds and their repositories.


su path changed after an update (Magisk variants)?
Check which su in adb shell and Termux; adjust PATH or reinstall termux-tools as needed.



Roadmap

Safer wrappers that auto‑detect su flavor and transparently fall back to tsu.
Emulator test matrix (MEmu, Genymotion, Waydroid) + smoke tests.
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (Android env, toybox/busybox, LD_LIBRARY_PATH).
docs/EMULATORS.md (graphics, SELinux quirks, I/O performance).
GitHub Actions: shellcheck, basic env smoke test (no privileged side‑effects).


Contributing

Open an issue with:

Device/emulator, Android version, uname -m, which su, tsu -V.


Reproduce with the health check and attach logs.
Submit PRs that avoid root package management and keep changes idempotent.

### Why I wrote it this way (and what changed)

- The README is **policy-compliant** (and safer for your contributors). Termux intentionally blocks `apt/pkg` under root; we **don’t** instruct circumventing that. Instead, we center the repo on **root‑aware** environment preservation (via `tsu`/`su -p` where appropriate) and keep package operations non‑root. [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/termux/comments/118x3qk/unable_to_install_packages_using_apt_or_pkg_on/)[3](https://github.com/Laikia/slavelabor)  
- I added a **repo layout** matching what I can see in *SlavLabor* and suggested pruning `memu_specific_enhancements - Copy.py` (duplicate). [1](https://github.com/ironkid90/SlavLabor)  
- Included **health checks**, **troubleshooting**, and a **roadmap** to move toward CI and better emulator coverage.

### Next steps I can take for you

1. **Push this README** to `SlavLabor` (or to `AgenticDreams` once it’s public).  
2. Add `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/EMULATORS.md`, and a **`scripts/healthcheck.sh`** file.  
3. Set up **GitHub Actions** for `shellcheck` and a non‑privileged smoke test.  
4. Optionally, add a **mermaid** diagram in the README (env-preservation flow).

Do you want me to open a PR to **SlavLabor** now, or wait and push to **AgenticDreams** once it’s visible?

If you later want a **more aggressive, research-only branch** that experiments with environment wrappers under root (clearly labeled as unsupported), I can isolate it behind feature flags and warnings so main stays safe.
